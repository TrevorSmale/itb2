## Instructor-Led

We will follow a lecture format with live demonstrations. I strongly encourage you to participate actively by replicating each demo as it is presented. 

> **Note:**
> Feel free to ask questions at the end of each section. If you need clarification or further information on any topic discussed, donâ€™t hesitate to speak up.

> **Note:**
> Given the extensive amount of concepts to cover during these three hours, it is highly recommended that you thoroughly review the notes before the next hands-on session.
