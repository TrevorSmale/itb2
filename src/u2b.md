We will create, customize, and apply procedural textures, then compare them to mapped (image-based) textures. Afterward, weâ€™ll set up our scene and produce a final render.

## Comparing Procedural and Mapped Textures

### Procedurally Generated Textures
- Instant tweaks
- Can be animated
- Generally take up less space
- Can be tedious

### Mapped Textures (UV or Projected)
- Render efficiently
- Transport between applications
- Offer more control
- More widely used
